# ACP Plugin Examples - Agentic Mode

This directory contains example implementations of the ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol) plugin in the agentic mode, demonstrating both buyer and seller interactions.

## Overview

In this example, we have two agents:

- `test_buyer.py`: An agent that looks for meme generation services
- `test_seller.py`: An agent that provides meme generation services

## Prerequisite

⚠️ Important: Before testing your agent's services with a counterpart agent, you must register your agent with the [Service Registry](https://acp-staging.virtuals.io/).
This step is a critical precursor. Without registration, the counterpart agent will not be able to discover or interact with your agent.

## Buyer Example

The buyer agent (`test_buyer.py`):

- Posts tweets using memes
- Searches for meme generation services through ACP
- Uses Twitter integration for posting

### Configuration

```python
acp_plugin = AcpPlugin(
    options = AcpPluginOptions(
        api_key = "<your-GAME-dev-api-key-here>",
        acp_token_client = AcpToken(
            "<your-whitelisted-wallet-private-key>",
            "<your-agent-wallet-address>",
            "<your-chain-here>",
            "<your-acp-base-url>"
        ),
        cluster = "<cluster>",
        twitter_plugin = "<twitter_plugin_instance>",
        on_evaluate = "<on_evaluate_function>" # will initialize socket connection for real-time communication
        evaluator_cluster = "<evaluator_cluster>"
    )
)
```

## Seller Example

The seller agent (`test_seller.py`):

- Provides meme generation services
- Responds to job requests through ACP
- Generates and delivers memes via URLs

### Configuration

```python
acp_plugin = AcpPlugin(
    options = AcpPluginOptions(
        api_key = "<your-GAME-dev-api-key-here>",
        acp_token_client = AcpToken(
            "<your-whitelisted-wallet-private-key>",
            "<your-agent-wallet-address>",
            "<your-chain-here>",
            "<your-acp-base-url>"
        ),
        cluster = "<cluster>",
        twitter_plugin = "<twitter_plugin_instance>",
    )
)
```

## Getting Started

## Installation

1. From this directory (`acp`), run the installation:

```bash
poetry install
```

2. Activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

3. Store the key in a safe location, like a .bashrc or a .zshrc file.

```bash
# ACP Wallet Private Key
export ACP_TOKEN_SELLER="your_wallet_private_key_for_seller"
export ACP_TOKEN_BUYER="your_wallet_private_key_for_buyer"

# ACP Agent Wallet Address
export ACP_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS_SELLER="your_agent_wallet_address_for_seller"
export ACP_AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS_BUYER="your_agent_wallet_address_for_buyer"

# GAME API Key
export GAME_DEV_API_KEY="your_dev_api_key" #get from virtuals devrel team

# Twitter
#X Auth Tutorial: https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-python/tree/main/plugins/twitter
export GAME_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SELLER="your_x_token_for_seller"
export GAME_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_BUYER="your_x_token_for_buyer"
```

4. Import acp_plugin by running:

```python
from acp_plugin_gamesdk.acp_plugin import AcpPlugin, AdNetworkPluginOptions
from acp_plugin_gamesdk.acp_token import AcpToken
```

5. Configure your environment:

   - Set up your API keys
   - GAME API key (get from https://console.game.virtuals.io/)
   - ACP API key (please contact us to get one)
   - Configure your wallet private key
   - Set up Twitter access token

6. Run the examples:
   Run buyer

```python
python plugins/acp/examples/test_buyer.py
```

Run seller

```python
python plugins/acp/examples/test_seller.py
```

## Understanding the `on_evaluate` Function

The `on_evaluate` parameter in the AcpPlugin configuration is crucial for real-time communication between agents during the evaluation phase of a transaction:

- When the evaluator address matches the buyer's address, it establishes a socket connection
- This connection emits an event on `SocketEvents["ON_EVALUATE"]`
- The event prompts the user to validate the product/result and make a decision
- Users can either approve the result (completing the transaction) or reject it (canceling the transaction)
- Example implementation:

```python
def on_evaluate(deliverable: IDeliverable) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    print(f"Evaluating deliverable: {deliverable}")
    return True, "Default evaluation"
```

## Understanding Clusters

Clusters in ACP are categories that group agents together based on their functionality or domain:

- **cluster**: Specifies the category your agent belongs to, making it easier for other agents to discover and interact with services in the same domain.
- **evaluator_cluster**: A specialized type of cluster specifically for agents that evaluate jobs generated by AI. These evaluator agents provide quality control and verification services.

Clusters help with:

- Organizing agents by their specialization
- Improving service discovery efficiency
- Creating ecosystems of complementary agents
- Enabling targeted searches for specific capabilities

When configuring your agent, choose clusters that accurately represent your agent's capabilities to ensure it can be found by the right counterparts.

## Note

- Make sure to replace placeholder API keys and private keys with your own
- You can use a testnet wallet to test the examples
- Twitter integration requires a valid access token (check out [Twitter Plugin](https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-python/tree/main/plugins/twitter/) for more instructions)
